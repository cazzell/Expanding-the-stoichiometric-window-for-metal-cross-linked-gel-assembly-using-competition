For detailed explaination, please see
"Expanding the stoichiometric window for metal cross-linked gel assembly using competition" PNAS, Cazzell (2019)
and reference accordingly.

There are 4 total functions, described below.

01 â€” predicts the plateau modulus as a function of pH and metal concentration for iron-nitrocatechol, aluminum-nitrocatechol and nickel-histidine, including and neglecting hydroxide interactions. Used to generate Figure 3.

02 - simulates the plateau modulus as a function of crosslinker 'B' concentration and competitor 'C' concentration of an A2+B3 network as the function of the binding strength of competitor C for crosslinker B, when mixed reactions occur. Used to generate Figure 1B.

03 - simulates the plateau modulus as a function of crosslinker 'B' concentration and competitor 'C' concentration of an A2+B3 network as the function of the binding strength of competitor C for crosslinker B, when partitioning occurs. Used to generate Figure 1B.

04 - simulates the plateau modulus as a function of metal crosslinker concentration and pH for a metal coordinated network as the function of the binding strength of competitor OH for crosslinker M. Used to generate Figure 1C.

Each function acts independently , only the director for the specific function you want to use should be added to your active path.

Each function include a data collection structure tree, which is a set of empty folder in the folder "Model".

Each function has a main script. This is the file where various parameters and options can be edited to tell the program what parameters to run.

The main scripts for each function are noted below.

01 - gel_mechanics_model

02 - Generalized_Driver

03 - Generalized_Driver

04 - gel_mechanics_model
